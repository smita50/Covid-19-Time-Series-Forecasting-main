# Covid-19-Time-Series-Forecasting
The novel Coronavirus, COVID-19 is a threat to the whole world. It has impacted economies, and the livelihood of countries and the people in them.
Time series data is a collection of observations obtained through repeated measurements over time. Plotting the points on a graph one of the axes would always be time.
This study aims to predict the number of confirmed individuals, vaccination and deaths by the coronavirus. The research is mainly focused on predicting time-series data using Arima and LSTM model. The result helps the health institutions and the public on the understanding of the impacts and influence of the coronavirus in their life and the importance to control its spread. 

Time-Series-Forecasting using Python:
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data
Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price,retail sales etc. Here we are trying to forecast the upcoming number of Covid-19 positive cases in india.
